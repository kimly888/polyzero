While the market price for a tonne fluctuates, we guarantee that your purchase will retire the equivalent amount of CO2 or more, to what is shown on the checkout screen. We anticipate that in many cases we may be able to off-set a higher volume than what is promised. As we purchase credits we will share the details on this page transparently so you can see specifically which projects are being supported."

    "This web-site is built and maintained by volunteers. No one on the team is being paid for their labor on the site. Further, to date all hosting costs have been borne out of pocket by project team members. As the project grows, we may opt to pay for the hosting costs from extra support funds (after carbon credits are purchased) if there are any left over. If this is the case, we commit to tracking these costs transparently here."
