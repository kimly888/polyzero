                  The plastic pollution crisis overwhelming our oceans is also a
                  significant and growing threat to the Earth’s climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nearly every piece of plastic begins as a fossil fuel, and
                  greenhouse gasses are emitted at each stage of the plastic
                  lifecycle:
                  <br /> 1) fossil fuel extraction and transport.
                  <br /> 2) plastic refining and manufacture.
                  <br /> 3) managing plastic waste.
                  <br /> 4) its ongoing impact in our oceans, waterways, and
                  landscape.

                  At current levels, greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic
                  lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep
                  global temperature rise below 1.5°C degrees.
                  <br /> By 2050, the greenhouse gas emissions from plastic
                  could reach over 56 gigatons—10-13 percent of the entire
                  remaining carbon budget.{" "}

                  If plastic production and use grow as currently planned, by
                  2030, these emissions could reach 1.34 gigatons per
                  year—equivalent to the emissions released by more than 295 new
                  500-megawatt coal-fired power plants.

                  entire remaining carbon budget. In 2019, the production and
                  incineration of plastic will produce more than 850 million
                  metric tons of greenhouse gasses—equal to the emissions from

                  “With little notice nationally, a new petrochemical and
                  plastics manufacturing hub may be taking shape along 300 miles
                  of the upper reaches of the Ohio River, from outside
                  Pittsburgh southwest to Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. It
                  would be fueled by a natural gas boom brought on by more than
                  a decade of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a drilling
                  process that has already dramatically altered the nation’s
                  energy landscape—and helped cripple coal.

                  But there’s a climate price to be paid. Planet-warming
                  greenhouse gas emissions from the Shell plant alone would more
                  or less wipe out all the reductions in carbon dioxide that
                  Pittsburgh, just 25 miles away, is planning to achieve by
                  2030. Drilling for natural gas leaks methane, a potent climate
                  pollutant; and oil consumption for petrochemicals and plastics
                  may account for half the global growth in petroleum demand
                  between now and 2050.”

                  A new study finds on average people could be ingesting
                  approximately 5 grams of plastic every week, which is the
                  equivalent weight of a credit card. The analysis No Plastic in

                  prepared by Dalberg, based on a study commissioned by WWF and

                  people are consuming about 2000 tiny pieces of plastic every
                  week. That’s approximately 21 grams a month, just over 250

                  There’s mounting evidence and growing concern about the impact
                  of some plastic chemicals and plastic particles on human
                  health.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Scientists have established links between everyday exposure to
                  chemical additives that leach from plastics and reproductive
                  health issues, brain health, obesity, diabetes and some types
                  of cancer. The effects are evident in babies, children, and
                  adults – young and old.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Microplastics – tiny particles of plastic under 5mm in length
                  – are known to be in our air, soil, rivers, oceans, plants and
                  animals. They are from degraded plastic products, textiles,
                  tyre abrasion, industry, agriculture and general waste.
                  Microplastics are also intentionally added to products, for
                  example cosmetics.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We know that microplastics get into our gut and lungs, but we
                  don’t yet know how far they penetrate our blood and organs nor
                  what impacts they have on human health. Concerningly, neither
                  do we know how far the smaller virus-sized nanoparticles
                  penetrate our bodies because we do not have suitable
                  techniques to measure them. What we do know is that plastic is
                  devastating our oceans, freshwater and land ecosystems that
                  are essential for all life.
