                Pack a reusable grocery bag, water bottle or mug, reusable straw
                and utensils in your everyday bag, so you always have them with
                you. When you decline plastic straws or cutlery make sure to do
                it at the time you place your order (not when you receive it).

                Purchasing in bulk, avoiding individually-wrapped single
                servings and other excess plastic packaging, asking for a glass
                or mug instead of a disposable cup at a cafe, these are all ways
                to reduce your plastic footprint. Apps such as GoodBye Waste
